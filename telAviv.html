Travel around Tel Aviv:<br>
How do you start a fun day in Tel Aviv?<br>
On a light trip, which will allow you to see lots of beautiful sides that you have not yet known.<br>
And here are some of our favorite routes in the city that never fall asleep:
<br>
Discover the magic of Neve Tzedek:<br>

Does Tel Aviv always feel a bit like a foreign country? <br>
This feeling may even intensify in Neve Tzedek. 
This sweet neighborhood is located in the southern part of the Tel Aviv promenade next to Jaffa, and is considered by many to be the most beautiful neighborhood in the city.

The most European route in Tel Aviv: <br>

The shady and chic Rothschild Avenue provides a variety of great reasons to visit, with its attractive location in the heart of the city, the cafes overlooking those who walk the avenue, the full pubs, the quality restaurants and the bustling cultural life, are just a part. 
<br> If we put aside for a moment all the entertainment options, we will discover an impressive Bauhaus building boulevard, which tells the fascinating story of the beginning of Tel Aviv and its first neighborhood, "Ahuzat Beit". <br>
This route will take you between contemporary Tel Aviv and stories of what was once here.

A celebration of shopping:<br>

A fun day in Tel Aviv is actually also a fun day in the shopping capital of Israel. 
<br>This is not new, because the first Hebrew city is also the main center of pilgrimage for all shopping enthusiasts wherever they are.
<br>
The downtown area (bounded by the streets: Arlozorov in the north, Ben Yehuda and Allenby in the west, Ibn Gvirol in the east and Rothschild Boulevard in the south), incorporates most of the clothing and footwear stores in the city.
<br> In this area you can find the fashionable and trendy Dizengoff Street, the highlight of which is, of course, the famous Dizengoff Center Mall, with its variety of brands, cafes and diverse stores.
<br>
Enjoy the beach scene in Tel Aviv:<br>
A fun day in Tel Aviv is not perfect without a jump into the sea.<br>
Anyone who wants a few refreshing hours and a relaxing escape from the hustle and bustle of the big city, can reach one of the accessible beaches of Tel Aviv, bathe, sunbathe, drink a cocktail or beer in one of the many beach restaurants or cafes and then return easily and quickly to the center.
