Isla Mujeres Paradise:<br>

Where to start at all - you usually fall in love with the clear water, the peaceful beaches and the relaxed atmosphere of the place.<br>
Playa Norte - "North Coast" - the area where most hikers "get stuck", a huge beach in its beauty, with whitish sand and almost dazzling turquoise waters ... restaurants, pubs, young atmosphere and endless back belly.<br>
It is said that there are two particularly common lies, about Isla Island: the first is "This is my last beer", the second "Tomorrow we leave".<br>
Isla is a quiet island with no water sports activities Isla's municipality intentionally does not license such activities in order to preserve the charm of the island, so most people, come to relax and sunbathe or the other activities the island has to offer.<br>
Everything I write here I learned from my visit to the place three times this year I recommend to everyone first thing when you come to the island is to go to the Chabad house to refresh and hear more about the island.
